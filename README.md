Hello my name is Rayyan Khalique and at the creation of this repository I am a Centennial High School IB MYP Sophomore. 
This repository is all of the code for the personal project product I made, which was a personal management to do list mobile application made with React Native and Expo. 

# To run my application you must: 
1. Git clone this repository onto your device.
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the app
   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
