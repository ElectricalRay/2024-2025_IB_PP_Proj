Hello my name is Rayyan Khalique and at the creation of this repository I am a Centennial High School IB MYP Sophomore. 
This repository is all of the code for the personal project product I made, which was a personal management to do list mobile application made with React Native and Expo. 

# Prerequisites:
Make sure you have the following installed before running the project: 
- Node.js
- Expo CLI

# To run my application you must: 

1. Git clone this repository onto your device.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ElectricalRay/2024-2025_IB_PP_Proj.git
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the app
   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can choose to build the app with Expo's EAS for cloud based development, or local development.
